3 steps

    Use fetch to get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API
        Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
            Image
            First and Last Name
            Email
            City
    Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
        Image
        Name
        Email
        Cell Number
        Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, state, and postcode.
        Birthdate
    Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.
        Display the users in a grid or table
        Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
        Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:
2 steps

    Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters result once they already on the page.
    Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
